# LLM Refinement Examples for Voice Transcription

## Example 1: Garbled Technical Instructions

### Original Voice Transcription (garbled with repetitions):
```
all right let's make a plan to address the first two of your key findings make sure to wait after you've updated our plan so I know that theright let's make a plan to address the first two of your key findings make sure to wait after you've updated our plan so I know that the 5,959090 has problems with installing pi torch, search the internet I think the solution is just to force install the most recent nightly build but confirm that .t but confirm that the old llama isHi search the internet I think the solution is just to force install the most recent nightly built but confirm that uh the old llama is running on windows and you're currently in the don't Pi search the internet I think the solution is just to force install the most recent nightly build but confirm that the old llama is running on windows and you're currently in the WSL linux environment commentLinux environment I think we should be fine buti think the solution is just to force install the most recent nightly build but confirm that uh the old llama is running on windows and you're currently in the WSL Linux environment I think we should be fine but check me out on that
```

### Refined Version:
```
Alright, let's make a plan to address the first two of your key findings. Make sure to wait after you've updated our plan so I know that the [model/system] has problems with installing PyTorch. Search the internet - I think the solution is just to force install the most recent nightly build, but confirm that. The old Llama is running on Windows and you're currently in the WSL Linux environment. I think we should be fine, but check me out on that.
```

## Key Refinement Points:
1. **Remove repetitions** - The same phrases were repeated multiple times
2. **Fix technical terms** - "pi torch" → "PyTorch", "llama" → "Llama"  
3. **Correct numbers** - "5,959090" → "[model/system]" (contextual correction)
4. **Add punctuation** - Proper sentence breaks and commas
5. **Remove fragments** - "commentLinux", "don't Pi", etc.
6. **Maintain intent** - Keep the technical request clear while removing noise

## Context Clues for Technical Refinement:
- WSL/Linux environment mentions → technical context
- PyTorch installation → ML/AI development context
- Llama → LLM model reference
- "nightly build" → software development terminology

This example shows how the LLM refiner should handle technical dictation with:
- Domain-specific vocabulary correction
- Repetition removal
- Fragment cleanup
- Context-aware corrections
