# Current Status - July 2025

## What Works ✅

### 1. **Research and Technology Decisions**
- Excellent analysis of Parakeet vs alternatives
- Clear understanding of LocalAgreement buffering concept
- Solid hardware optimization strategy (dual GPU)
- Well-researched audio configuration decisions

### 2. **Parakeet Transcription**
- NVIDIA Parakeet transcription engine works
- Can process audio and produce text output
- GPU utilization confirmed

### 3. **LLM Integration Concept**
- Ollama integration approach is sound
- LLM refinement examples demonstrate value
- Hotkey-triggered approach is practical

## What's Broken ❌

### 1. **Windows Audio Capture - BLOCKING ISSUE**
- Audio hardware integration fails on Windows
- Cannot capture microphone input reliably
- System won't launch due to audio failures
- No isolated testing to debug this separately

### 2. **Missing Core Feature**
- **LocalAgreement buffering not implemented** - This is the main differentiator
- No committed vs pending text logic
- Still suffers from the "rewriting delay" problem we wanted to solve

### 3. **Implementation Complexity**
- Over-engineered package structure
- Files scattered across multiple directories
- Cannot quickly iterate and test changes
- Too complex for rapid debugging

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Step 1: Windows Audio Debugging (TODAY)
**Goal**: Get basic audio capture working on Windows

**Action**: Create and test `test_audio_minimal.py`
```python
import sounddevice as sd
import numpy as np

def test_windows_audio():
    devices = sd.query_devices()
    print("Available devices:", devices)
    
    duration = 5
    audio = sd.rec(int(duration * 16000), samplerate=16000, channels=1)
    sd.wait()
    print(f"Captured {len(audio)} samples, max level: {np.max(np.abs(audio))}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_windows_audio()
```

**Success Criteria**: Shows available devices, captures 5 seconds, reports non-zero audio level

### Step 2: Single-File Dictation Prototype (TOMORROW)
**Goal**: End-to-end working system in one file

**Action**: Create `dictation_minimal.py` with:
- Basic audio capture (using Step 1 solution)
- Parakeet transcription (existing working code)
- Simple keyboard output via `keyboard.write()`
- F4 hotkey to start/stop

**Success Criteria**: Can dictate speech that appears as text in any application

### Step 3: LocalAgreement Logic (NEXT)
**Goal**: Implement the core differentiating feature

**Action**: Add committed vs pending text logic to `dictation_minimal.py`
**Success Criteria**: Text stabilizes and doesn't rewrite previously "committed" portions

## DO NOT DO YET (Avoid Scope Creep)

- [ ] Package structure reorganization
- [ ] Complex testing frameworks
- [ ] EXE packaging and distribution
- [ ] WebSocket server architecture
- [ ] Multiple model support
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Status overlay UI
- [ ] Smart application detection

## Key Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Must work on Windows** - Primary target platform
- **Parakeet transcription works** - Don't change what's not broken
- **Audio capture is the blocker** - Focus here first

### Implementation Constraints
- **Single files only** - Until basic functionality works
- **Manual testing** - Automated testing comes later
- **Inline code** - No complex imports or dependencies

### Feature Constraints
- **LocalAgreement first** - Core differentiator takes priority
- **Basic hotkeys only** - F4 toggle, that's it initially
- **Simple text output** - keyboard.write() until injection works

## Recovery Indicators

### Good Progress Signs
- Windows audio test passes
- Can capture and transcribe simple speech
- Text appears in applications (Notepad, browser, etc.)
- System runs without crashes

### Ready for Next Phase Signs
- Basic dictation works reliably on Windows
- LocalAgreement logic prevents text rewrites
- Can demonstrate superior user experience vs standard STT

## Context for Future Conversations

When resuming work on this project:

1. **Read SCOPE_CREEP_LESSONS.md first** - Understand what went wrong
2. **Focus on current blocking issue** - Windows audio capture
3. **Use single-file approach** - Don't suggest complex architectures
4. **Test on Windows immediately** - Every change must work on target platform
5. **Implement LocalAgreement next** - This is the core innovation

The project is technically sound but got derailed by scope creep. Simple, focused implementation will get us back on track.
