# Enhanced Injection System Summary

## Overview

The v3 Flet implementation now includes two comprehensive enhanced injection modules that provide full feature parity with v2:

### 1. `enhanced_injection_strategies.py`
A modular strategy-based injection system with:
- **Multiple injection strategies**: UI Automation, Keyboard, Clipboard, Win32 SendInput, Basic Keyboard
- **Strategy pattern implementation**: Each strategy is a self-contained class
- **Performance tracking**: Built-in statistics for each strategy
- **Application-aware injection**: Strategies can adapt based on the target application
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Multiple retry patterns within each strategy

### 2. `injection_manager_enhanced.py`
The complete enhanced injection manager with:
- **All v2 strategies ported**: UI Automation, Keyboard, Clipboard, Win32 SendInput
- **Performance optimization**: Dynamic strategy ordering based on success rates
- **Comprehensive statistics**: Tracks success rates, timing, and application-specific performance
- **Asynchronous injection**: Non-blocking text injection support
- **Fallback display callback**: Alternative display when all strategies fail
- **Application detection integration**: Automatically detects and optimizes for current app

## Key Features

### Strategy Implementation Details

#### UI Automation Strategy
- Uses Windows COM objects for reliable text insertion
- Multiple pattern support: TextPattern, ValuePattern, LegacyIAccessiblePattern
- Fallback to keyboard injection if patterns fail
- Best for: Rich text editors, complex applications

#### Enhanced Keyboard Strategy
- Direct keyboard simulation with rate limiting
- Character-by-character fallback for problematic apps
- Small focus acquisition delay
- Best for: Simple text fields, terminals

#### Enhanced Clipboard Strategy
- Format-preserving clipboard operations
- Saves and restores original clipboard content
- Win32 clipboard API support for better reliability
- Retry mechanism for paste operations
- Best for: Large text blocks, formatted content

#### Win32 SendInput Strategy
- Low-level Windows API for Unicode support
- Direct input injection bypassing higher-level APIs
- Character-by-character sending with proper key events
- Best for: When other strategies fail, special characters

### Performance Tracking

The system tracks comprehensive performance metrics:
- **Per-strategy statistics**: Success rate, average time, consecutive failures
- **Application-type distribution**: Which apps use which strategies
- **Dynamic optimization**: Strategies are reordered based on performance
- **Failure tracking**: Identifies problematic applications or scenarios

### Integration with Application Detection

The enhanced injection system fully integrates with the application detector:
- Automatically detects the current application
- Applies application-specific strategy ordering
- Uses optimized timing delays per application
- Tracks performance per application type

## Usage Examples

```python
from core.injection_manager_enhanced import injection_manager

# Basic injection
success = injection_manager.inject_text("Hello, world!")

# Application-aware injection
app_info = injection_manager.get_current_application()
success = injection_manager.inject_text("Context-aware text", app_info)

# Async injection
injection_manager.inject_text_async("Non-blocking injection")

# Get performance statistics
stats = injection_manager.get_performance_stats()
print(f"Success rate: {stats['success_rate_percent']}%")

# Force specific strategy order
injection_manager.force_strategy_order(['clipboard', 'keyboard', 'ui_automation'])

# Set fallback display
def show_in_ui(text):
    print(f"Fallback display: {text}")
injection_manager.set_fallback_display(show_in_ui)
```

## Testing

The `test_enhanced_injection.py` file provides comprehensive testing:
- Basic injection tests
- Strategy performance tracking
- Application-specific optimization
- Fallback display functionality
- Async injection
- Performance statistics and reset

## Migration Status

âœ… **Completed**:
- All v2 injection strategies ported
- Performance tracking system
- Application integration
- Async injection support
- Fallback mechanisms
- Comprehensive testing

ðŸš§ **Platform-Specific** (Week 5):
- Linux injection strategies (currently Windows-focused)
- KDE Wayland support
- macOS injection methods

## Architecture Benefits

The v3 enhanced injection system improves on v2 by:
1. **Single-process architecture**: No WebSocket communication delays
2. **Direct function calls**: Immediate strategy execution
3. **Thread-safe design**: Proper locking for multi-threaded access
4. **Better error handling**: Comprehensive failure tracking
5. **Performance optimization**: Dynamic strategy reordering

## Next Steps

1. Install platform-specific dependencies for full functionality
2. Test with various applications to build performance profiles
3. Implement Linux-specific injection strategies
4. Add configuration UI for strategy preferences
5. Create application-specific profiles for common apps
