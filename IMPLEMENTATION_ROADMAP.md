# PersonalParakeet Implementation Roadmap
*Focused 21-Day Development Strategy*

## Executive Summary

**Architecture Decision: FastAPI Wrapper Approach**
- Rationale: 6/10 vs 8/10 maintenance burden, superior production readiness
- Integration Effort: Medium (2-3 weeks)
- Production Benefits: WebSocket support, REST API, monitoring

## Three-Phase Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Days 1-7)
**Goal**: Minimal viable transcription with LocalAgreement buffering

**Files to Create**:
1. `app/main.py` (~50 lines) - FastAPI app with health endpoint
2. `algorithms/local_agreement.py` (~120 lines) - Core text buffering class
3. `app/transcription.py` (~80 lines) - Basic Whisper integration
4. `app/config.py` (~40 lines) - Configuration management
5. `requirements.txt` (~25 lines) - Core dependencies

**Success Metrics**:
- Basic transcription working locally
- LocalAgreement reducing text flickering by 70%
- Sub-300ms end-to-end latency
- Memory usage under 4GB

### Phase 2: Audio Pipeline Integration (Days 8-14)
**Goal**: Real-time audio processing with VAD

**Files to Create**:
1. `audio/capture.py` (~100 lines) - PyAudio integration
2. `audio/vad.py` (~80 lines) - Voice activity detection
3. `audio/preprocessing.py` (~60 lines) - Audio preprocessing
4. `app/websocket_handler.py` (~150 lines) - WebSocket real-time updates
5. `gpu/manager.py` (~90 lines) - GPU resource management

**Success Metrics**:
- Real-time audio capture and processing
- VAD reducing false transcriptions by 80%
- WebSocket delivering updates under 100ms
- Stable operation for 1+ hours

### Phase 3: Production Optimization (Days 15-21)
**Goal**: RTX optimization and production deployment

**Files to Create**:
1. `gpu/optimization.py` (~110 lines) - RTX 5090/3090 optimizations
2. `docker-compose.yml` (~40 lines) - Containerized deployment
3. `tests/` directory (~300 lines total) - Comprehensive testing
4. Performance monitoring endpoints (~50 lines)
5. Documentation and deployment guides (~200 lines)

**Success Metrics**:
- 75-150ms latency on RTX 5090
- 95%+ uptime in production
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Ready for user deployment

## Day 1-3 Concrete Tasks

### Day 1: Foundation Setup
**Morning (4 hours)**:
- Create project structure and virtual environment
- Implement `app/config.py` with GPU detection and model paths
- Set up `requirements.txt` with core dependencies (FastAPI, Whisper, PyTorch)

**Afternoon (4 hours)**:
- Implement `app/main.py` with basic FastAPI app and health endpoints
- Create `algorithms/local_agreement.py` with TextBuffer class (~120 lines)
- Basic unit tests for LocalAgreement algorithm

**Files Created**: 4 files, ~215 lines total
**Deliverable**: Running FastAPI app with LocalAgreement algorithm

### Day 2: Transcription Core
**Morning (4 hours)**:
- Implement `app/transcription.py` with Whisper model loading and inference
- Add GPU detection and model optimization for available hardware
- Integration with LocalAgreement for stable text output

**Afternoon (4 hours)**:
- Create basic audio file processing endpoint
- Test transcription accuracy with sample audio files
- Performance profiling and initial optimization

**Files Created**: 2 files, ~150 lines total
**Deliverable**: Working transcription service with text stabilization

### Day 3: Audio Input Foundation
**Morning (4 hours)**:
- Implement `audio/capture.py` with PyAudio integration
- Add audio format conversion and basic preprocessing
- Test real-time audio capture from microphone

**Afternoon (4 hours)**:
- Create `audio/vad.py` with voice activity detection
- Integrate VAD with audio capture for smart recording
- Basic WebSocket setup in `app/websocket_handler.py`

**Files Created**: 3 files, ~230 lines total
**Deliverable**: Real-time audio capture with voice detection

## Scope Creep Prevention

**DO NOT DO until basic functionality works**:
- NO advanced ML features in Phase 1
- NO multi-language support initially  
- NO complex UI beyond basic WebSocket
- NO advanced audio processing beyond VAD
- NO EXE packaging or deployment optimization
- NO comprehensive testing frameworks

**Weekly Scope Reviews**:
- Day 7: Phase 1 complete or timeline adjustment
- Day 14: Phase 2 complete or feature reduction  
- Day 21: Production readiness assessment

## Success Criteria & Fallback Strategies

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] LocalAgreement reduces text flickering by 70%
- [ ] End-to-end latency under 300ms
- [ ] Memory usage under 4GB
- [ ] Basic transcription accuracy >85%

**Fallback**: If metrics not met, simplify LocalAgreement algorithm or reduce model size

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- [ ] Real-time audio processing with <100ms delay
- [ ] VAD reduces false positives by 80%
- [ ] WebSocket stable for 1+ hour sessions
- [ ] Audio quality maintained through preprocessing

**Fallback**: Use simpler VAD or reduce audio processing complexity

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] RTX 5090 latency 75-150ms
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] 95%+ uptime in testing
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation complete

**Fallback**: Deploy with reduced optimization or extend timeline

## Immediate Next Steps

### Week 1 Action Items
1. **Day 1**: Set up development environment and create foundation files
2. **Day 2**: Implement core transcription with LocalAgreement
3. **Day 3**: Add real-time audio capture and VAD
