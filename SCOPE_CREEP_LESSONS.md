# What Went Wrong - Scope Creep Analysis

## Original Goal
- Single-session implementable prototype
- LocalAgreement buffering as core feature
- Community wrappers over complex implementations

## Where We Went Wrong

### 1. **Technology Complexity Creep**
**Should have done**: Use community wrappers (FastAPI or parakeet-mlx)
**Actually did**: Full NVIDIA NeMo integration (`nemo-toolkit[asr]`)
**Result**: Added expertise requirements we don't have

### 2. **Architecture Complexity Creep**
**Should have done**: Single-file prototype for quick iteration
**Actually did**: Full Python package with setup.py, entry points, complex structure
**Result**: Files scattered everywhere, harder to debug

### 3. **Feature Priority Inversion**
**Should have done**: LocalAgreement buffering first (core differentiator)
**Actually did**: Everything except the main feature
**Result**: Complex system that doesn't solve the original problem

### 4. **Testing Complexity Creep**
**Should have done**: Manual testing until basic functionality works
**Actually did**: Elaborate test infrastructure that doesn't run
**Result**: Can't quickly validate changes

## Red Flag Phrases to Avoid in Future Conversations

- "Let's create a proper package structure"
- "We should use the full NeMo framework"
- "Let's add comprehensive testing infrastructure"
- "We need proper error handling" (before it works)
- "Let's make this production-ready"
- "We should support multiple models"
- "Let's add WebSocket support"
- "This needs better architecture"

## Current Blocking Issue

### Primary Problem: Windows Audio Capture
- **Parakeet transcription works fine** - Not the problem
- **Audio capture fails on Windows** - Specific integration issue
- **Can't isolate-test audio** - No separate testing components
- **System won't launch** - Prevents validation of anything

### Secondary Problems
- **Missing core LocalAgreement feature** - The main innovation isn't implemented
- **Too complex to debug** - Package structure makes quick changes hard
- **Premature optimization** - Focused on EXE packaging before basic functionality

## Recovery Strategy

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Create test_audio_minimal.py** - Single file to isolate Windows audio issue
2. **Get basic audio capture working** - Use sounddevice with simple configuration
3. **Create dictation_minimal.py** - Single file with Parakeet + audio + keyboard
4. **Test end-to-end on Windows** - Prove basic concept works

### DO NOT DO UNTIL BASIC FUNCTIONALITY WORKS
- Package structure refactoring
- Complex testing frameworks
- EXE packaging and distribution
- WebSocket server architecture
- Multiple model support
- Extensive documentation
- Error handling frameworks

## Lessons for Future AI Conversations

When starting a new Claude conversation about this project:

1. **Read this file first** - Understand what went wrong
2. **Stick to single-file prototypes** - Don't suggest complex architectures
3. **Focus on the core feature** - LocalAgreement buffering is the main goal
4. **Windows audio is the blocker** - Solve this before anything else
5. **Resist feature creep** - If it's not in the original research docs, defer it

## Success Indicators

### Good Signs
- Single files that do one thing well
- Quick iteration cycles
- Windows audio capture works
- LocalAgreement logic implemented
- Text appears in applications

### Warning Signs
- Multiple directories and complex imports
- Can't quickly test changes
- Adding features before basic functionality works
- Discussing architecture instead of solving problems
- Talking about "best practices" for a prototype
