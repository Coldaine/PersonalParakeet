# PersonalParakeet Enhancements Summary

## Completed Enhancements

### 1. Fixed Text Output Callback System ✅
- **Issue**: Keyboard.write() errors in threading context
- **Solution**: 
  - Added thread safety detection
  - Implemented fallback using keyboard.press_and_release()
  - Added small delays to ensure window focus
  - Enhanced error logging with context information

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling ✅
- **Audio Callback**:
  - Added try-catch blocks for audio processing
  - Implemented queue size limiting to prevent overflow
  - Better error reporting with specific exception types

- **Process Audio Loop**:
  - Added consecutive error tracking (max 5 errors before stopping)
  - Separate error handling for transcription vs LocalAgreement processing
  - GPU out-of-memory handling with cache clearing
  - Graceful degradation on repeated failures

- **Text Injection**:
  - Multiple injection methods with fallback chain
  - Console display fallback after 3 injection failures
  - Detailed error logging for debugging

- **Start/Stop Operations**:
  - Proper cleanup of audio queues before starting
  - Thread daemon mode for cleaner shutdown
  - Better error messages for audio device issues

- **Main Entry Point**:
  - Specific error handling for common issues:
    - PortAudioError → Microphone connection hints
    - CudaError → GPU/driver troubleshooting
    - ImportError → Dependency installation guidance
  - Comprehensive cleanup in finally block

## Key Improvements

### Thread Safety
- Detection of main vs background thread execution
- Proper handling of keyboard module threading limitations
- Thread-safe queue operations with size limits

### Fallback Mechanisms
1. Primary: keyboard.write()
2. Secondary: keyboard.press_and_release() with delays
3. Tertiary: Console display with copy/paste instructions

### Error Recovery
- Automatic recovery from transient errors
- Graceful degradation for persistent issues
- Clear user feedback for troubleshooting

### Resource Management
- Proper cleanup of audio streams
- Thread join with timeout
- Hotkey removal on exit
- Queue clearing before restart

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite:
- `test_enhanced_dictation.py`: Tests error handling and fallback mechanisms
- `test_keyboard_output.py`: Tests various keyboard injection scenarios
- Thread safety testing with concurrent outputs

## Usage

Run the enhanced system:
```bash
python run_enhanced_dictation.py
```

Or directly:
```bash
python run_dictation.py
```

Both will use the enhanced SimpleDictation class with all improvements.

## Latest Enhancements

### 3. Audio Device Selection ✅
- **Command-line arguments**:
  - `--list-devices` or `-l`: List all available audio input devices
  - `--device INDEX` or `-d INDEX`: Use specific device by index
  - `--device-name NAME` or `-n NAME`: Find device by partial name match
- **Interactive selection**: Fallback to interactive selection if default fails
- **Device validation**: Tests device before use, provides helpful error messages
- **AudioDeviceManager class**: Comprehensive device management utilities

### 4. Improved Cleanup Handling ✅
- **Signal handlers**: Graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C and SIGTERM
- **Comprehensive cleanup method**: 
  - Stops audio streams properly
  - Clears GPU memory
  - Flushes pending text
  - Removes hotkeys
- **Resource management**: 
  - Stream marked as None after close
  - Audio queue cleared on stop
  - Thread join with timeout
- **Error resilience**: Cleanup continues even if individual steps fail

## Usage Examples

```bash
# List available audio devices
python run_dictation.py --list-devices

# Use specific device by index
python run_dictation.py --device 2

# Find device by name
python run_dictation.py --device-name "Blue Yeti"

# Use default device (original behavior)
python run_dictation.py
```

## Next Steps

Remaining high-priority tasks from the implementation plan:
1. ~~Polish working system - Add device selection, cleanup handling~~, and config options (partially complete)
2. Implement intelligent text injection - Create app detection and injection strategies
3. Add advanced Voice Activity Detection - Integrate Silero + WebRTC VAD

The core system now has robust error handling, device selection, and proper cleanup mechanisms.
