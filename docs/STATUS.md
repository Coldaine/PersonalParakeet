# PersonalParakeet v3 - Current Status & Roadmap

**Date**: July 26, 2025  
**Version**: 3.0.0-alpha  
**Overall Progress**: 20% Complete (Realistic Assessment)

## Project Overview

PersonalParakeet v3 is a complete rewrite using Flet (Python-native UI framework) with a single-process architecture. This replaces the problematic v2 WebSocket/Tauri design.

**Reality Check**: While individual components exist, end-to-end functionality is not proven. True progress requires working integration, not just file count.
