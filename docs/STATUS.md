# PersonalParakeet v3 - Current Status & Roadmap

**Date**: July 26, 2025
**Version**: 3.0.0-alpha
**Overall Progress**: 45% Complete (Core architecture and major features ported)

## 1. Project Overview

PersonalParakeet v3 is a complete rewrite using Flet with a single-process architecture. This version replaces the problematic v2 WebSocket/Tauri design, resulting in a more stable and maintainable application.

## 2. Completed Features

### Core Architecture
-   **Flet UI Framework**: Floating transparent window with Material Design.
-   **Single-Process Design**: No WebSocket, no IPC, no race conditions.
-   **Producer-Consumer Audio**: Thread-safe audio pipeline with `queue.Queue`.

### Audio & STT
-   **Audio Engine**: Microphone capture with device detection.
-   **VAD Engine**: Voice activity detection with pause detection.
-   **STT Integration**: Real NeMo/Parakeet integration with intelligent fallback to a mock processor.

### Text Processing & Injection
-   **Clarity Engine**: Rule-based text corrections ported from v2.
-   **Enhanced Injection System**: Multi-strategy support (UI Automation, Keyboard, Clipboard, etc.) with performance tracking and application-aware optimization.

### UI Components
-   **Dictation View**: Main floating UI with transparency and status indicators.
-   **Controls**: Basic controls for start/stop, clear, and commit.

### Testing
-   **Component Tests**: For UI and core components.
-   **Integration Tests**: For the full audio -> STT -> injection pipeline.
-   **Hardware Tests**: For microphone and GPU detection.

## 3. In Progress (Next 2 Weeks)

-   **STT Integration**: Finalizing NeMo toolkit installation and addressing any remaining RTX 5090 compatibility issues.
-   **End-to-End Testing**: Validating the complete audio-to-text-injection pipeline with the real STT model.
-   **Configuration UI**: Building the UI for runtime settings changes and profile management.
-   **Enhanced Thought Linking**: Upgrading the basic thought linking to a more intelligent, context-aware system.

## 5. Key Milestones

-   **Milestone 1: Core Functionality (Achieved)**: Real STT integration tested, text injection working.
-   **Milestone 2: Feature Complete (In Progress)**: Port all remaining v2 features.
-   **Milestone 3: Production Ready**: PyInstaller packaging, cross-platform testing, and performance optimization.

## 6. Known Issues

-   **RTX 5090 Compatibility**: Some non-blocking PyTorch warnings may persist.
-   **Linux Injection**: Currently limited to X11 applications.
-   **Audio Queue Overflow**: Can occur under heavy load with the mock STT; needs monitoring with the real model.
