# PersonalParakeet v2 Dictation View - Current Status

## âœ… Working Components

### Core Infrastructure
- **RTX 5090 Support**: PyTorch with CUDA 12.1+ compatibility verified
- **Audio Capture**: Cross-platform audio input working correctly
- **NeMo Toolkit**: Parakeet-TDT-1.1B model integration complete
- **Clarity Engine**: Real-time text corrections (ultra-fast rule-based) âœ…

### Dictation View UI Architecture
- **Framework**: Tauri/React for native performance with web technologies
- **Glass Morphism**: Transparent interface with blur effects
- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time updates between backend and frontend
- **Adaptive Sizing**: Dynamic content-based window sizing
- **Cross-platform**: Windows primary, expandable to Linux/macOS

### Backend Integration
- **WebSocket Bridge**: `workshop_websocket_bridge.py` with full integration
- **Clarity Engine**: Built-in corrections for homophones and technical jargon
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Pause-based automatic commit functionality
- **Configuration System**: JSON-based settings management

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd dictation-view-ui && npm install && cd ..

# Start Dictation View system
python start_dictation_view.py
```

The launcher will:
1. Check prerequisites (CUDA, Rust, Node.js)
2. Start Python WebSocket backend with integrated components
3. Launch Tauri UI with real-time transcription display

## ðŸ“‹ Development Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- Dictation View UI foundation with Tauri/React
- WebSocket communication architecture
- Clarity Engine integration (6 essential corrections)
- Voice Activity Detection with pause triggers
- Basic commit & control logic

### ðŸš§ In Active Development  
- **Command Mode** - "Parakeet Command" voice activation pattern
- **Intelligent Thought-Linking** - Multi-sentence composition logic
- **Enhanced UI Polish** - Improved animations and visual effects

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Priority Tasks
1. Implement Command Mode voice activation system
2. Add Intelligent Thought-Linking for coherent multi-utterance composition
3. Polish UI animations and visual feedback
4. Comprehensive testing and documentation

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

- **First run**: Tauri compilation takes 1-2 minutes initially
- **Performance**: Clarity Engine averages 0ms correction time
- **Configuration**: All settings managed via `config.json`
- **Testing**: Manual testing with real microphone input required

## ðŸ’¡ Architecture Philosophy

PersonalParakeet v2 embraces transparency over complexity. Instead of hiding the inherent "messiness" of real-time speech recognition, we expose it in a beautiful, controlled interface that gives users full visibility and control while delivering perfectly clean results to their target applications.
