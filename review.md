# Code Review: Detailed Changes Summary

This document provides a detailed review of the recent changes to the codebase, generated from the `git diff HEAD` command.

## Key Changes Overview

The latest modifications focus on several areas:
- **Dependency Management**: Switched from nightly PyTorch builds to stable releases for better CI portability.
- **Code Style & Consistency**: Standardized import statement ordering across многочислennыm Python source files.
- **Test Framework Enhancements**: Improved pytest configuration by adding type hints, custom markers, and preventing unintended test collection.

## File-by-File Breakdown

### 1. `.swarm/memory.db`
- **Change**: The binary file `.swarm/memory.db` was deleted from the repository.

### 2. `pytest.ini`
- **Change**: A minor formatting adjustment was made to the file for consistency.

### 3. `requirements-torch.txt`
- **Change**: The PyTorch dependencies were updated to use stable releases instead of nightly builds.
  - **Previous**: Nightly builds (`torch`, `torchvision`, `torchaudio`)
  - **Current**: Stable releases (`torch>=2.8.0`, `torchvision>=0.19.0`, `torchaudio>=2.8.0`)
- **Reason**: This change enhances the portability of the continuous integration (CI) pipeline and ensures a more stable and predictable environment.

### 4. Python Source Files (`src/personalparakeet/**/*.py`)
- **Change**: Import statements in numerous Python files were reordered to follow a consistent structure.
- **Details**: The new import order is:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Third-party library imports
  3. Local application imports
- **Impacted Files**: This change was applied to multiple files across the `src/personalparakeet/` directory, improving code readability and maintainability.

### 5. Test Files (`tests/**/*.py`)

#### `tests/conftest.py`
- **Change 1**: Added a type hint to the `event_loop` fixture for improved code clarity.
- **Change 2**: Registered a new `unit` marker in the pytest configuration, allowing for more granular test selection.

#### `tests/core/test_reporter.py`
- **Change**: Added `__test__ = False` to the utility class.
- **Reason**: This prevents pytest from incorrectly collecting the class as a test case, ensuring that only actual tests are executed.

#### `tests/unit/test_config.py` & `tests/unit/test_thought_linker.py`
- **Change**: Marked both test files with `pytest.mark.unit`.
- **Reason**: This categorizes them as unit tests, allowing for targeted test runs using the newly registered `unit` marker.
