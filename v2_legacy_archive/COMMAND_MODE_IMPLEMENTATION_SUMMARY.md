# Command Mode Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the work done to implement Command Mode for PersonalParakeet v3 Flet.

## Overview

Implemented a complete Command Mode system for PersonalParakeet v3 that allows users to control the application through voice commands using a two-step activation pattern:
1. "Hey Parakeet" - activates command mode
2. Voice command - executes the desired action

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created

1. **`v3-flet/core/command_processor.py`**
   - Main command processing engine implementing the two-step activation pattern
   - Based on the proven v2 implementation but adapted for Flet architecture
   - Supports core commands: clear text, commit text, toggle listening, toggle clarity
   - Includes async callbacks for UI state updates
   - Graceful error handling for unrecognized commands
   - Visual feedback for command mode status

2. **`v3-flet/tests/test_command_processor.py`**
   - Basic test file to verify command processor functionality

3. **`v3-flet/README.md`**
   - Comprehensive setup and usage guide for the v3-flet project
   - Includes project structure, dependencies, and running instructions

4. **`v3-flet/setup.sh`**
   - Automated setup script for creating virtual environment and installing dependencies

### Files Modified

1. **`v3-flet/audio_engine.py`**
   - Integrated command processor into the audio processing pipeline
   - Added command processor initialization and callback setup
   - Modified transcription handling to process commands first
   - Added methods for command mode control and callbacks

2. **`v3-flet/ui/dictation_view.py`**
   - Added command mode state tracking
   - Set up command mode status callback
   - Added toggle command mode functionality
   - Updated UI state updates to reflect command mode status

3. **`v3-flet/ui/components.py`**
   - Enabled and connected the command mode button in the control panel
   - Added callback for toggling command mode
   - Updated control panel to properly display command mode status

## Key Features Implemented

### Two-Step Activation Pattern
- First step: Say "Hey Parakeet" to activate command mode
- Second step: Say the actual command
- Visual feedback when in command mode

### Core Voice Commands
- **Text Management**: "commit text", "clear text"
- **Clarity Engine Control**: "enable clarity", "disable clarity", "toggle clarity"
- **Dictation Control**: "start listening", "stop listening"
- **Mode Control**: "exit command mode", "cancel", "nevermind"
- **System Commands**: "show status"

### Flet Integration
- Async callbacks for real-time UI updates
- Command mode status indicator in the UI
- Visual feedback through control panel button color changes
- Integration with existing UI state management

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback for unrecognized commands
- Command timeout handling (returns to normal mode after 5 seconds)
- Confidence-based command detection to minimize false positives
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Architecture

The implementation follows the single-process Flet architecture without WebSocket messages:

```
Audio Input → AudioEngine → CommandProcessor → DictationView (UI)
                    ↓
            STTProcessor/ClarityEngine/VADEngine
```

The CommandProcessor intercepts speech input when command mode is enabled and processes it before passing it to the normal transcription pipeline.

## Configuration

Command mode is configurable through the existing V3Config system:
- Activation phrase: "hey parakeet" (default)
- Confidence threshold: 0.8 (default)
- Command timeout: 5.0 seconds (default)
- Can be enabled/disabled through UI or configuration

## Testing

Basic functionality can be tested with the included test file:
```bash
cd v3-flet
python tests/test_command_processor.py
```

## Dependencies

The implementation uses only the existing project dependencies:
- Flet for UI
- Standard Python libraries for core functionality
- No additional external dependencies required

## Future Improvements

1. Add more voice commands for enhanced functionality
2. Implement command confirmation for high-impact actions
3. Add visual indicators for command mode in the UI
4. Implement command history and learning
5. Add support for parameterized commands
