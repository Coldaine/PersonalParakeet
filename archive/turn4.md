# Summary of Implemented Improvements (Turn 4)

This document summarizes the changes made based on the implementation instructions provided in `turn3.md`.

## 1. Replace print() with Proper Logging

**What was done:**
- Created a new file `personalparakeet/logger.py` containing a `setup_logger` function. This function configures a Python `logging` instance with both a console handler (for immediate feedback) and a file handler (for persistent logs in `~/.personalparakeet/logs/personalparakeet.log`).
- Modified the following files to import and use the new logging system:
    - `personalparakeet/application_detection.py`
    - `personalparakeet/basic_injection.py`
    - `personalparakeet/dictation.py`
    - `personalparakeet/kde_injection.py`
    - `personalparakeet/linux_injection.py`
    - `personalparakeet/text_injection.py`
    - `personalparakeet/windows_injection.py`
    - `personalparakeet/windows_clipboard_manager.py`
    - `personalparakeet/linux_clipboard_manager.py`
- Replaced all `print()` statements in these files with appropriate `logger.info()`, `logger.warning()`, `logger.error()`, or `logger.debug()` calls, ensuring consistent and configurable logging throughout the text injection system.

## 2. Fix KDE Magic Numbers

**What was done:**
- Modified `personalparakeet/kde_injection.py`.
- Changed the `inject` method within `KDESimpleInjector` to replace the magic numbers `6` and `7` with `X.KeyPress` and `X.KeyRelease` respectively. This involved adding `from Xlib import X` to the imports of the file.

## 3. Improve Clipboard Restoration Safety

**What was done:**
- Created a new abstract base class `personalparakeet/clipboard_manager.py` for robust clipboard management, including `save_clipboard` and `restore_clipboard` methods with retry logic.
- Implemented platform-specific concrete classes:
    - `personalparakeet/windows_clipboard_manager.py`: Uses `win32clipboard` for Windows-specific clipboard operations.
    - `personalparakeet/linux_clipboard_manager.py`: Uses `subprocess` calls to `xclip`, `xsel`, or `wl-copy` for Linux-specific clipboard operations.
- Modified `personalparakeet/windows_injection.py` and `personalparakeet/linux_injection.py`:
    - Replaced direct `win32clipboard` or `subprocess` clipboard calls with instances of `WindowsClipboardManager` and `LinuxClipboardManager` respectively.
    - Integrated the `save_clipboard()` and `restore_clipboard()` methods from the new clipboard managers into the `inject` methods of `WindowsClipboardStrategy` and `LinuxClipboardStrategy`.

## 4. Refactor Long Methods

**What was done:**
- Modified `personalparakeet/text_injection.py`.
- Broke down the `_get_strategy_order` method into smaller, more focused helper methods:
    - `_get_windows_strategy_order`
    - `_get_linux_strategy_order`
    - `_get_kde_strategy_order`
    - `_get_x11_strategy_order`
- This improves readability and maintainability of the strategy selection logic.

## 5. Make Delays Configurable

**What was done:**
- Modified `personalparakeet/config.py`:
    - Added new configuration parameters to the `InjectionConfig` dataclass, including `xdotool_timeout`.
- Modified `personalparakeet/text_injection.py`:
    - Updated `TextInjectionManager.__init__` to accept an optional `InjectionConfig` object, defaulting to a new instance if not provided.
    - Passed the `self.config` object to the constructors of all platform-specific injection strategies (`WindowsUIAutomationStrategy`, `WindowsKeyboardStrategy`, `WindowsClipboardStrategy`, `KDESimpleInjector`, `LinuxXTestStrategy`, `LinuxXdotoolStrategy`, `LinuxATSPIStrategy`, `LinuxClipboardStrategy`, and `BasicKeyboardStrategy`).
- Modified `personalparakeet/windows_injection.py`, `personalparakeet/linux_injection.py`, `personalparakeet/kde_injection.py`, and `personalparakeet/basic_injection.py`:
    - Updated the `__init__` methods of all relevant `TextInjectionStrategy` subclasses to accept and store the `config` object.
    - Replaced hard-coded `time.sleep()` calls and `timeout` values in `inject` methods with references to `self.config` attributes (e.g., `self.config.focus_acquisition_delay`, `self.config.xdotool_timeout`, `self.config.clipboard_paste_delay`).

## 6. Enhance Documentation

**What was done:**
- Added comprehensive docstrings to the `inject_text` method in `personalparakeet/text_injection.py`, following the specified template. This includes detailed descriptions of arguments, returns, potential exceptions, examples, and notes.

## 7. Additional Improvements

**What was done:**
- Created a new file `personalparakeet/constants.py` to centralize various constants, including logging emojis and platform detection lists. This promotes code reusability and easier management of global values.

These changes collectively enhance the system's robustness, maintainability, and configurability, addressing the key areas identified in the revised code review.
