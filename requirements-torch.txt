# PyTorch Requirements for RTX 5090 (CUDA 12.8)
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-torch.txt
# This file manages PyTorch separately from Poetry due to complex CUDA versioning

# Prefer stable releases for CI portability; keep extra index for CUDA wheels if available
--extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple

# Use stable PyTorch stack versions that exist across platforms
torch>=2.8.0
torchvision>=0.19.0
torchaudio>=2.8.0

# Notes:
# - Nightly pins previously used (torch>=2.9.0.dev...) caused resolution failures on macOS.
# - CI jobs install CPU wheels by default unless CUDA runtime is present.
# - Validate CUDA availability separately when running GPU-specific workflows.
