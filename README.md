# PersonalParakeet ðŸ¦œ

**Real-time dictation with a transparent floating UI, AI-powered corrections, and a unique "LocalAgreement" buffering system to prevent text rewrites.**

PersonalParakeet v3 is a complete rewrite with a single-process architecture using Flet.

## Core Features & Requirements

-   **LocalAgreement Buffering**: The core innovation that prevents jarring text rewrites by only committing text that is stable across multiple transcription updates.
-   **High-Performance STT**: GPU-accelerated speech recognition using NVIDIA Parakeet, with a target accuracy of 6.05% WER.
-   **Floating UI**: A transparent, draggable dictation window that floats above other applications.
-   **Clarity Engine**: Real-time, rule-based text corrections for homophones and technical jargon.
-   **Smart Text Injection**: Multi-strategy, platform-aware text input that adapts to the active application.
-   **Advanced VAD**: Dual VAD system (Silero + WebRTC) for robust and accurate speech detection.
-   **Configuration Profiles**: Pre-tuned profiles (e.g., "Fast Conversation", "Accurate Document") that can be switched at runtime.

## Quick Start
